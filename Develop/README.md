# Password Generator Starter Code
## I had to help a an employee generate a strong password using the criteria I had given them. I had to make sure the password was more than 8 characters no more than 12, also that it had uppercase, lowercase and special chara ters. 

## Insallation
The code to my github is- git@github.com:alondrazz/friendly-parakeet.git
And the url is- https://alondrazz.github.io/friendly-parakeet/

## Usage
People can use this for whenever they're starting off and need a guide to help them set up a password generator.
## Credits
I used a couple different pages to get help, one helped me get started, another gave me the coding to generating a password and the last one was a tutorial on how to make it work. I was struggling to get my coding to work and the video really helped guide me.
